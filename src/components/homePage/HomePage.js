        <h3>bio</h3>
        <p>
          Hey and thanks for visiting my small corner of the internet. I'm a
          software developer with a passion for good product design and
          business. I enjoy brainstorming new ideas and then building them. I
          love working on projects that help people, and if you or your company
          does that then I'd love to talk.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I'm passionate about many things, including education & coaching,
          climate tech & electric vehicles, and photography. I think
          well-written code, good design, and a strong business model can go a
          really long way.
        </p>
